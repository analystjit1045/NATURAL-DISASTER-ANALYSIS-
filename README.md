EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS ABOUT THE RISE OF NATURAL DISASTERS 

#OBSERVATIONS:

1. From the queries we can analyze the distribution of disaster events across different decades, which could reveal patterns or shifts in disaster frequencies over longer time periods, potentially linked to larger-scale environmental or societal changes.

2. From the queries we attempt to shed light on the the earliest recorded occurrences of each disaster type, which in return could help us  on the historical emergence or improved detection capabilities for different natural hazards.

3. Since the analysis covers a long period filtering for the 21st century & examining on the pre 21st century disasters ,it enables us to identifyt he changes or shifts in disaster occurrences over an extended period, which could provide insights into long-term trends or potential underlying factors.

# NATURAL-DISASTER-ANALYSIS-
EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS ABOUT THE RISE OF NATURAL DISASTERS 

#OBSERVATIONS:

1. From the queries we can analyze the distribution of disaster events across different decades, which could reveal patterns or shifts in disaster frequencies over longer time periods, potentially linked to larger-scale environmental or societal changes.

2. From the queries we attempt to shed light on the the earliest recorded occurrences of each disaster type, which in return could help us  on the historical emergence or improved detection capabilities for different natural hazards.

3. Since the analysis covers a long period filtering for the 21st century & examining on the pre 21st century disasters ,it enables us to identifyt he changes or shifts in disaster occurrences over an extended period, which could provide insights into long-term trends or potential underlying factors.

4. The Analysis was aimed in understanding the distribution ,trends & patterns of each disaster type allowing for a more granular understanding of their occurrences and potential impacts.

5. The Analysis focus on quantifying the frequency and severity of different disaster types by calculating measures such as the total number of disasters, average number of disasters per year, and identifying the top years or entities with the highest number of disasters. This analysis can help rank and compare the relative magnitude and impact of various disaster types.

6. The queries aim to analyze disaster trends over time, including identifying years or decades with the highest number of disasters, both overall and for specific disaster types. Calculating the cumulative number of disasters, particularly for earthquakes, over time allows for understanding long-term trends and patterns.
